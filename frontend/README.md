# React + Vite

I built this project following a tutorial from Master JS to practice using React, Vite, and TailwindCSS. I wanted to learn how to create modern UI/UX designs and add cool animations, like Parallax effects that move when you scroll or use your mouse.

## Features 
- Parallax Animations: scrolling and mouse-moving effects to make the page more interesting.
- Complex UI Geometry: Practiced using Tailwind CSS to create fun shapes and grids
- Latest UI Trends: Implemented modern design patterns like Bento grids to keep up with current frontend design trends.
- Responsive: Ensured the site is functional and visually appealing across different devices, learning about responsive design in the process.
- Get Demo: Have some fun chatting with the AI, made by the backend service I built! 

## Deploy
I used Hostinger- https://www.hostinger.com for frontend deployment especially for static website 



Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
